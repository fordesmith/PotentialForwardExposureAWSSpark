# PFE estimation using AWS EMR

This is a step by step proof of concept for estimating potential future exposure with QuantLib and AWS EMR. 

Amazon EMR provides a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable Amazon EC2 instances. You can also run these other popular distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, and Flink in Amazon EMR, and interact with data in other AWS data stores such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.

In other words, if you use common big data Apache tools, you should seriously consider Amazon EMR because it makes the configuration process as painless as it can be. A big advantage of AWS over other platforms for the enterprise user, especially in highly regulated financial services domains is the wide selection of features including security & permissions. 

Thatâ€™s not to say it is always easy to set up, though.
